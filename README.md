2 hour coding challenge for WSECU interview.

Things I would have liked to improve:
- Total price before placing an order
- Better / friendlier looking interface
- Use of nested divs over table for better styling capabilities
- Cleaner transaction log stored in SQL over a text file

Noteable things missing:
- No refund transactions
- No API for viewing transactions due to time limitations, only transactional dump on main page
