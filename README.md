2 hour coding challenge for WSECU interview.
-----
This was created utilizing a LAPP stack, but primarily using PHP as a method to handle server-side data and JavaScript to handle browser-side interactions.


General thought process:
- Utilize localized file vs SQL database due to time constraints
- Have data in an understood format (JSON) that can be expanded upon if time allowed

Things I would have liked to improve:
- Total price being displayed before placing an order
- Better / friendlier looking UI
- Use of nested divs over table for better styling capabilities
- Cleaner transaction log stored in SQL over a text file

Noteable things missing:
- No refund transactions
- No API for viewing transactions individually due to time limitations, only transactional dump on main page
